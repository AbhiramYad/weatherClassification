# weatherClassification

This project processes video frames and classifies them based on weather conditions using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. It consists of three main components:

frameGenerator.py - Extracts frames from a video, classifies them based on weather, and organizes them into appropriate folders.

mainweatherpredictor.py - Predicts the weather conditions for a set of test images and stores the results in a CSV file.

wethearpredictor.py - Trains a weather classification model using labeled images and saves the trained model.
